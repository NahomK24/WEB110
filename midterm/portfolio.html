                <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! Here you'll find the projects I've been working on during my web development journey. As a marketing student learning web development, I'm proud of the progress I've made so far, and I'm excited to continue building more complex projects as I learn.</p>
                <p>Most of these projects were created as part of my coursework at JCCC, while others are personal projects I've worked on to practice my skills. These websites showcase my growing ability to create digital experiences that support marketing goals.</p>
                <p>I appreciate any feedback on my work as I continue to grow my technical skills!</p>

                <h3>My First Website</h3>
                <div class="project-container">
                    <img src="first website.png" alt="Screenshot of my first website" class="project-img">

                        <p class="project-date">Completed: February 10</p>
                        <p>This was the first website I ever created using HTML. It was a fun project that allowed me to dive into the basics of web development. I gained a deeper understanding of how websites are structured and how HTML plays a role in laying out content.</p>
                        <p>The site includes a home page, an about page, and a contact page, all created from scratch. I used Notepad++ for coding, which was a simple but effective tool to start with.</p>
                        <p>Technologies used: HTML, Notepad++</p>

                <h3>Cafe Website</h3>
                <div class="project-container">
                    <img src="cozy cafe.png" alt="Screenshot of cafe website" class="project-img">

                        <p class="project-date">Completed: February 17</p>
                        <p>This project introduced me to the world of CSS and how it can be used to style websites. Although it was a bit more challenging, it was a valuable learning experience, and I was able to successfully create a cozy atmosphere that matched the cafe theme. Through this project, I learned how to incorporate colors, fonts, and layout techniques to make the site more visually appealing.</p>
                        <p>The site includes a home page, a menu page, an about page, and a contact page. By experimenting with different styling elements, I was able to develop my skills further and start thinking about user experience and design.</p>

                        <p class="project-date">Completed: March 10</p>
                        <p>This project marked a big milestone for me, as it was the first time I worked with images in a website. The challenge was ensuring that everything looked good and that the pictures were properly integrated. After some trial and error, I learned how to optimize the images and use them effectively to enhance the visual experience.</p>
                        <p>The site features destination guides, photo galleries, and detailed information about various travel destinations. It focuses on showcasing destinations with a visually engaging design to captivate users.</p>

                        <p>The latest project showcases everything I've learned so far. It combines various features from my previous projects and brings them all together into a single cohesive website. I was able to apply all the knowledge and skills I gained from previous projects to create a more refined, functional, and visually appealing site.</p>
                        <p>Building this project was much easier with the experience and practice I gained from my earlier work. It was a fun challenge to create a complete website that shows how far my web development skills have come.</p>
